Titanic Data Science Praject
==============================

Kaggle-titanic Dataset

This is a tutorial in an IPython Notebook for the Kaggle competition, Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster. The goal of this repository is to provide an example of a competitive analysis for those interested in getting into the field of data analytics or using python for Kaggle's Data Science competitions .

<p><small>Project based on the <a target="_blank" href="https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/">cookiecutter data science project template</a>. #cookiecutterdatascience</small></p>


In a form of a jupyter notebook, my solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline:

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Modeling
Modelfine-tuning
